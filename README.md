# Online Shopping platform(E-commerce website)
## About:
Welcome to the E-Commerce Website project! This web application is designed to provide a seamless online shopping experience to users while empowering administrators with efficient management tools. The website is built using Java, Spring Boot, JSP, and Front-end technologies, ensuring a robust and scalable foundation for your e-commerce venture.
  
In this project the user can visit the website, register themselves, and log in using their credentials. Following a successful login, a user can view all products featured on the website, filter products based on categories, or just perform a product search. If it is in stock, the user may read product details by clicking on a specific item and can either add it to their cart or immediately purchase it. Moreover the user can also add a specific product to his wishlist by clicking the tiny love button in the upper right corner. Also, he has access to his wishlist under the profile area and may change it there. The user has the option to add numerous products to their cart, change the number of those products, or delete them entirely. Once the shopping cart is prepared, the customer can proceed to the checkout where he can edit the delivery address, choose a payment option, and continue. The user can check order information and their status in the profile section after a successful order. Additionally, the user's profile section allows him to change his personal information.

The project has an admin panel where the administrator can login and add categories and products to the store. Additionally, he has the ability to add or update the categories or products based on demand or to completely eliminate existing ones. The administrator is also allowed to view all products ordered by user and modify the order status. Additionally, has the ability to delete users who are engaging in deceptive behavior and can add another admin to share responsibilities.
One of the best features of the project is the mailing system. The user receives an email upon successfully registering on the website, and they also receive an email confirming their order of any products or when those products have been shipped from the store. In addition, the user receives an OTP for password reset in the event that they forget their password and want to change it.
